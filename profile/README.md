## International Capital Market Association

## About
Welcome to the International Capital Market Association
For over 50 years ICMA and its members have worked together to promote the development of the international capital and securities markets, pioneering the rules, 
principles and recommendations which have laid the foundations for their successful operation.

In pursuit of its objectives, ICMA brings together members from all segments of the wholesale and retail debt securities markets, through regional and sectoral 
member committees, and focuses on a comprehensive range of market practice and regulatory issues which impact all aspects of international market functioning. 
ICMA prioritises three core fixed income market areas – primary, secondary, repo and collateral: with two cross-cutting themes of sustainable finance and FinTech and digitalisation.

ICMA currently has around 620 members active in all segments of international debt capital markets in 66 jurisdictions globally. Among our members are private and 
public sector issuers, banks and securities dealers, asset and fund managers, insurance companies, law firms, capital market infrastructure providers and central banks.

ICMA is a not-for-profit association (Verein) under the Swiss Civil Code. The Association is headquartered in Zurich, with offices in London, Paris, Brussels and 
Hong Kong and registered in the Zurich Commercial Register.
